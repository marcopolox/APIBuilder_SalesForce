 * You can create additional configuration files to that the server will load based on your

 * than your local development environment, you can create a production.js and a local.js.  Any changes
 * in those files will overwrite changes to this file (a object merge is performed). By default, your
 * local.js file will not be commited to git or the registry.
 *
 * This is a JavaScript file (instead of JSON) so you can also perform logic in this file if needed.
